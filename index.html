        <p>This website is gonna tell you about a bunch of different dinosaur facts.</p>

        <h2>Ceratopsians</h2>

        <p>They are the horned dinosaus.</p>

        <h3>Triceratops</h3>

        <p><em>try-serra-tops</em></p>

        <p><em>When: 76-66 million years ago (late Cretaceous)</em></p>

        <p>
            Triceratops had a big frill that was probably for display. But its horns were a weapon
            to get meat-eating dinosaurs away. It was as heavy as a 10-ton truck. Triceratops was built like
            a huge rhinoceros. It lived at the end of late Cretaceous. That's it for triceratops.
        </p>

        <h3>Styracosaurus (my favorite)</h3>

        <p><em>sty-rack-oh-sore-us</em></p>

        <p><em>When: 74-66 million years ago (late Cretaceous. A lot of ceratopsians lived at that time.)</em></p>

        <p>
            Styracosaurus had one horn and a big frill. Styracosaurus had big, sharp spikes on the frill.
            It was about the same size as a human. That's in for styracosaurus.
        </p>

        <h3>Protoceratops</h3>

        <p><em>pro-toe-serra-tops</em></p>

        <p><em>When: 74-66 million years ago (late Cretaceous)</em></p>

        <p>
            Protoceratops was the smallest ceratopsian ever discovered. Protoceratops had one tiny horn
            and a small frill. That's in for protoceratops.
        </p>

        <p>That's not all the ceratopsians, but I think we can move on.</p>

        <h2>Iguanodontians</h2>

        <p>Most of them have sharp thumb spikes.</p>

        <h3>Iguanodon</h3>

        <p><em>ig-gwah-no-don</em></p>

        <p><em>When: 135-125 million years ago (eary Cretaceous)</em></p>

        <p>
            It had a very big thumb spike that was probably used for defense. It was four-legged and it was
            a lot bigger than a human!! It could stand on two legs and four legs. That's it for iguanodon.
        </p>

        <p>I don't know that much about any other iguanodontians.</p>

        <h2>Hadrosaurs</h2>

        <p>Most of them had crests.</p>

        <h3>Parasaurolophus</h3>

        <p><em>pa-ra-sore-oh-loaf-us</em></p>

        <p><em>When: 76-74 million years ago (late Cretaceous)</em></p>

        <p>
            It had a big crest to make sound. It was probably the same size as iguanodon.
            It probably lived in groups.
        </p>

        <h3>Maiasaura</h3>

        <p><em>my-a-sore-a</em></p>

        <p><em>When: 80-74 million years ago (late Cretaceous)</em></p>

        <p>
            It was a very good mother, and father. It made nests and had a lot of eggs.
        </p>

        <h3>Corythosaurus</h3>

        <p><em>ko-rith-oh-sore-us</em></p>

        <p><em>When: 76-75 million years ago (late Cretaceous)</em></p>

        <p>
            It also had a large crest to make sound but it was in a different shape.
            Probably the same size as parasaurolophus. It walked on four legs.
        </p>

        <h2>Ankylosaurs</h2>

        <p>They are the armored ones.</p>

        <h3>Ankylosaurus</h3>

        <p><em>ank-ill-oh-sore-us</em></p>

        <p><em>When: 70-66 million years ago (late Cretaceous)</em></p>

        <p>
            It had a giant club tail and it used it to battle predators. It was the biggest
            ankylosaur. It had armor all over it. And its name means "armored head."
        </p>

        <h3>Gargoyleosaurus</h3>

        <p><em>gar-goil-oh-sore-us</em></p>

        <p><em>When: 155-145 million years ago (late Jurassic)</em></p>

        <p>
            It was a very small dinosaur. Same size as a goat. It had armor all down it, but in the
            place where its back connected to its tail was a big plate of armor. It
            did not have a club tail.
        </p>

        <h3>Gastonia</h3>

        <p><em>gas-toe-nee-ah</em></p>

        <p><em>When: 125 mill years ago (early Cretaceous)</em></p>

        <p>
            When it swings its tail the spikes on its tail cross each other acting like a big weapon.
            It was probably the same size as a human. It was 13 feet long (4 meters). It had spikes
            all over it except on its belly. Its legs were like elephant legs! It's a very cool
            dinosaur.
        </p>

        <p>That's it for the category.</p>
