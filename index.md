# Dinosaur Fun Facts

> This website is gonna tell you about a bunch of different dinosaur facts.

## Ceratopsians

They are the horned dinosaus.</p>

### Triceratops

_try-serra-tops_

_When: 76-66 million years ago (late Cretaceous)_

Triceratops had a big frill that was probably for display. But its horns were a weapon
to get meat-eating dinosaurs away. It was as heavy as a 10-ton truck. Triceratops was built like
a huge rhinoceros. It lived at the end of late Cretaceous. That's it for triceratops.

### Styracosaurus (my favorite)

_sty-rack-oh-sore-us_

_When: 74-66 million years ago (late Cretaceous. A lot of ceratopsians lived at that time.)_

Styracosaurus had one horn and a big frill. Styracosaurus had big, sharp spikes on the frill.
It was about the same size as a human. That's in for styracosaurus.

### Protoceratops

_pro-toe-serra-tops_

_When: 74-66 million years ago (late Cretaceous)_

Protoceratops was the smallest ceratopsian ever discovered. Protoceratops had one tiny horn
and a small frill. That's in for protoceratops.

That's not all the ceratopsians, but I think we can move on.

## Iguanodontians

Most of them have sharp thumb spikes.

### Iguanodon

_ig-gwah-no-don_

_When: 135-125 million years ago (eary Cretaceous)_

It had a very big thumb spike that was probably used for defense. It was four-legged and it was
a lot bigger than a human!! It could stand on two legs and four legs. That's it for iguanodon.

I don't know that much about any other iguanodontians.

## Hadrosaurs

Most of them had crests.

### Parasaurolophus

_pa-ra-sore-oh-loaf-us_

_When: 76-74 million years ago (late Cretaceous)_

It had a big crest to make sound. It was probably the same size as iguanodon.
It probably lived in groups.

### Maiasaura

_my-a-sore-a_

_When: 80-74 million years ago (late Cretaceous)_

It was a very good mother, and father. It made nests and had a lot of eggs.

### Corythosaurus

_ko-rith-oh-sore-us_

_When: 76-75 million years ago (late Cretaceous)_

It also had a large crest to make sound but it was in a different shape.
Probably the same size as parasaurolophus. It walked on four legs.

## Ankylosaurs

They are the armored ones.

### Ankylosaurus

_ank-ill-oh-sore-us_

_When: 70-66 million years ago (late Cretaceous)_

It had a giant club tail and it used it to battle predators. It was the biggest
ankylosaur. It had armor all over it. And its name means "armored head."

### Gargoyleosaurus

_gar-goil-oh-sore-us_

_When: 155-145 million years ago (late Jurassic)_

It was a very small dinosaur. Same size as a goat. It had armor all down it, but in the
place where its back connected to its tail was a big plate of armor. It
did not have a club tail.

### Gastonia

_gas-toe-nee-ah_

_When: 125 mill years ago (early Cretaceous)_

When it swings its tail the spikes on its tail cross each other acting like a big weapon.
It was probably the same size as a human. It was 13 feet long (4 meters). It had spikes
all over it except on its belly. Its legs were like elephant legs! It's a very cool
dinosaur.

That's it for the category.
