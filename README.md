# Dinosaur Fun Facts

In the spring of 2022, my six year old kiddo asked me:

> “Can you make a website called dinosaur dot com that shows a bunch of dinosaur facts?”

And in that moment I leaned that they know exactly what I do for work.

This website is their work. They wanted to list amazing facts of just some of the dinosaurs they've learned about. They wrote all the copy, and it was so much fun being their scribe. They chose the GitHub pages design they wanted the frontend to use, and GitHub made it easy to automate all the development.
