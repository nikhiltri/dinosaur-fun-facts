# Dinosaur Fun Facts

In the spring of 2022, my six year old kiddo asked me:

> “Can you make a website called dinosaur dot com that shows a bunch of dinosaur facts?”

And in that moment I leaned that he knows exactly what I do for work.

This website is his work. He wanted to list amazing facts of just some of the dinosaurs he's learned about. He wrote all the copy, and it was so much fun being his scribe. He chose the GitHub pages design he wanted the frontend to use, and GitHub made it easy to automate all the development.
