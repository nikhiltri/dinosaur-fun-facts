## Giganotosaurus

In Jurassic World, the giganotosaurus was black and grey. It had an EPIC... battle with a T-rex. Giganotosaurus is my second favorite dinosaur.

## Quetzelcoatlus

It ran at Owen and someone else on a bridge. It also attacked the same two people on ice. That is my favorite dinosaur.

## Atrociraptor

_uh-tross-uh-rap-tor_

A group of atrociraptors including Ghost, Red, Tiger, and more chased Owen on a motorcycle. They're really powerful hunters.

## Tyranosaurus Rex

In the movie it scares Claire, it also is part of the giganotosaurus battle. And it wins!
